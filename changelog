velvet (0.7.44-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added bibliographic information in BibTeX format in debian/references.
  * debian/rules: touch zlib to avoid third-party zlib to be built.
  * Removed ‘debian/patches/20_external_zlib.patch’. Passing apropriate
    variables in debian/rules is enough to build dynamically on Debian's
    zlib.
  * Removed the quilt patch system (debian/control, debian/README.source
    debian/rules).
  * Incremented Standards-Version in debian/control to reflect conformance
    with Policy 3.8.2 (no changes needed).
  * Corrected the installation of files that were moved from the
    ‘third-party’ directory to the ‘contrib’ directory.
  * Experimentation on debian/copyright.

velvet (0.7.34-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release correcting multiple bugs, changing the stats output,
    allowing optional scaffolding and multiple rounds of Pebble.
  * Added the programs velveth_de and velvetg_de to the package in /usr/bin,
    and the scripts shuffleSequences_fasta.pl and shuffleSequences_fastq.pl in
    /usr/share/velvet (debian/rules, debian/install).
  * Refreshed debian/copyright. 
  * Temporarly disabled the manpage generation of velvetg* because the --help
    option is not available (debian/rules).

velvet (0.7.31-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.1 (no changes needed)
  * Create manpages using help2man
  * Move third-party/layout and third-party/afg_handling to examples
    because these scripts are actually not to run velvet but for
    the convenience of users - in /urs/share/velvet these scripts
    seem to be perfectly hidden and in /usr/share/doc/velvet might
    create users attendance
  * Added missing quilt entry in debian/rules
