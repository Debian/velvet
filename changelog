velvet (0.7.31-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.1 (no changes needed)
  * Create manpages using help2man
  * Move third-party/layout and third-party/afg_handling to examples
    because these scripts are actually not to run velvet but for
    the convenience of users - in /urs/share/velvet these scripts
    seem to be perfectly hidden and in /usr/share/doc/velvet might
    create users attendance
