Description: Nucleic acid sequence assembler for very short reads
 Velvet is a de novo genomic assembler specially designed for short read
 sequencing technologies, such as Solexa or 454, developed by Daniel Zerbino and
 Ewan Birney at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), near
 Cambridge, in the United Kingdom.
 .
 Velvet currently takes in short read sequences, removes errors then produces
 high quality unique contigs. It then uses paired read information, if
 available, to retrieve the repeated areas between contigs.
 .
 Velvet was published in: `Velvet: algorithms for de novo short read assembly
 using de Bruijn graphs.  D.R. Zerbino and E. Birney. Genome Research
 18:821-829.'
