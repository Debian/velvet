velvet (0.7.34-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release correcting multiple bugs, changing the stats output,
    allowing optional scaffolding and multiple rounds of Pebble.
  * Added the programs velveth_de and velvetg_de to the package in /usr/bin,
    and the scripts shuffleSequences_fasta.pl and shuffleSequences_fastq.pl in
    /usr/share/velvet (debian/rules, debian/install).
  * Refreshed debian/copyright. 
  * Temporarly disabled the manpage generation of velvetg* because the --help
    option is not available (debian/rules).

velvet (0.7.31-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.1 (no changes needed)
  * Create manpages using help2man
  * Move third-party/layout and third-party/afg_handling to examples
    because these scripts are actually not to run velvet but for
    the convenience of users - in /urs/share/velvet these scripts
    seem to be perfectly hidden and in /usr/share/doc/velvet might
    create users attendance
  * Added missing quilt entry in debian/rules
